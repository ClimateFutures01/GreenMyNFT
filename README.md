Green NFT Hackathon Entry for Awareness Prize

See www.GreenMyNFT.org for the awareness raising NFT offset portal that allows people to estimate their NFT carbon emissions and compare them to other activities.

See pdf presentation here: https://climatefutures.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Climate-Futures-Green-NFT-Hackathon-Awareness-Prize.pdf

Some highlights about the GreenMyNFT portal:

- The portal can be used to compare NFT emissions to other activities and learn about your general carbon footprint.
- The NFT calculator uses an improved algorithm for historic transactions which is more accurate.
- It can also be used to offset the NFT emissions and to promote green NFTs by creating a green NFT gallery for the community.
- It can also be used to educate people on climate solutions and solutions for the crypto/NFT community.
- Can easily be linked to from any other website etc.
- It will be able to use ERC20 1PLANET 1PLCO2 tokens for offsetting in the near future. Currently it uses PayPal and HyperLedger Fabric.
